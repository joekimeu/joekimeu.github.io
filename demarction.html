            <h3>Demarcation: Practical Tool or Oppresive Force?</h3>

            <p>Generation Z was born into a paradigm shift in the layman’s philosophical view of the world. America, already a secular society, experienced a wave of atheism in the 1960’s that has not ceased. The proliferation of handheld cell phones and the internet connected the world and its various ideas. Some facilitate better technology; others are confusing. Among these is the practice of indiscrimination: notions like gender and race saw their arbitrary lines questioned ceaselessly. F. Scott Fitzgerald and James Joyce, through The Dead and Babylon Revisited, help determine whether discrimination may benefit individuals.</p>

            <p>Postmodernists denigrate absolutism by basing their worldview on perpetual relativism: an absolute, and, therefore, a contradiction. Dealing with the world is complicated, so incoherencies are expected when attempting to understand it. Albert Einstein confirmed this in the early 20th century by redefining physics and parametrizing the bounds of space to include time: his famous theories on spacetime. His work, however, is still unexplained. Unlike Einstein and physicists, F. Scott Fitzgerald and James Joyce revolutionized my view of spacetime with their great works and without confusion, albeit in two different ways.</p>

            <p>Joyce published his masterpiece, The Dead, in 1907, under the collection of works titled Dubliners. Throughout it, he attempts to imbue life with meaning and does so successfully in its closing piece, The Dead. The story’s protagonist, Gabriel Conroy, is forced to confront time’s varied effects on the life of his country and his relationships.</p>

            <p>The story’s genesis takes place in a grand mansion, where both a dance and a dinner occur. Gabriel Conroy, our protagonist, dances with a woman termed Miss Ivors, and through her, is forced to confront time’s corrosive effects on his homeland. Miss Ivors notes, quite roughly that “you [Gabriel] write for the Daily Express” (The Dead, 13). Conroy’s left-leaning and seemingly radical affiliation indicates his desire for Ireland, his country, to orient itself in the right direction: the time for a change is now.</p>

            <p>Later, Conroy delivers a speech to a receptive crowd, whom he implores to embody “certain qualities of hospitality, of humor, of humanity which the new and very serious and hypereducated generation that is growing up around us seems to me to lack” (The Dead, 19). Through Gabriel’s speech, readers are offered a glimpse into Joyce’s view on the many oddities intrinsic to time and its passing.
            </p>

            <p>Joyce expounds upon this insight later as Gabriel contemplates his wife, Gretta. “Moments of their [Gabriel and Gretta’s] secret life together burst like stars upon his memory. A heliotrope envelope was lying beside his breakfast cup, and he was caressing it with his hand. Birds were twittering in the ivy, and the shimmery web of the curtain was shining upon the floor: he could not eat for happiness” (The Dead, 19). The past, like an infinitely dense point in space that 13.8 billion years ago that resulted in “The Big Bang,” emanates into the present moment. Time is a tesselated string, containing various points in space, a conjecture Einstein nor postmodernists would disprove.
            </p>

            <p>Conroy made his aforementioned speech, having understood the many oddities of Irish history that benefited and corroded the country’s current fabric. He also seeks memories of his wife to analyze his current infatuation; he sees how the past and the present are often inseparable, but this is a mistake. 
            </p>

            <p>The Dead’s ending details the protagonist’s reflection upon this realization. Gabriel ponders that everything is essentially “a shade like the shade of Patrick Morkan and his horse” (The Dead, 50). As a result, “his soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.” (The Dead, 52). Fundamentally, Conroy’s journey through The Dead rendered him incapable of demarcating the present states from the future, leaving him bitter, swooning, and nihilistic. F. Scott Fitzgerald, however, presents a better mode of living.
            </p>

            <p>In Babylon Revisited, the protagonist is Charlie, a formerly wealthy man who had much and lost more. He is in a city attempting to reclaim his daughter Honoria, but doing so requires confronting and accepting the past as a separate reality, much to a postmodernist’s chagrin. Charlie fails to do this at the story’s onset when he doles his phone number to a bartender to reconnect with past friends. Like Gabriel from The Dead, he is tying himself to the past and bringing it to the present moment, believing both to be monolithic, in some sense. This results in his daughter’s temporary guardians eliminating contact between the two for many months. </p>

            <p>However, he demarcates himself from the past by tapering his alcohol use, regaining financial stability, and forming a salient relationship with himself. He, therefore, no longer needs old acquaintances because he is a new man: “He wanted his child now, and nothing was much good now besides that fact” (Babylon Revisited, 15). Although Charlie is unsuccessful in attaining his pursuit within the confines of the story, his ability to separate the past from the present renders him a better, mission-orient, hopeful, and less shallow individual; Charlie found an antidote to nihilism.
            </p>

            <p>Postmodernism may have valid critiques, but its insistence on moral relativity is not one. In an infinitely complex world, absolutes or social constructs are necessary to simplify it and provide hope to human beings. James Joyce effectively displays what occurs when a human fails to demarcate: they see the past and the present as a string whose beginning molds the inextricably linked end. Believers in such a theory are neither wrong nor right. F. Scott Fitzgerald relays that future realities bounded by our past need demarcation to pursue an uphill journey of life, with purpose and self-belief, a realization Gabriel and seemingly Ireland never had. 
            </p>

            <p>The past, the present, and the future are the same yet different. Quantum mechanics shows that electrons should be in many places simultaneously. Post-modernists claim relativism as an absolute. The bigger takeaway from these stories is that life is paradoxical, and I will never get the full picture. So, I’ll certainly remain confused, but this need not be an issue in the uphill journey.
